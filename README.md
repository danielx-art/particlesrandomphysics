***Welcome!***

This a particle system simulation, where particles ara initally spawn randomly and also act according to certain random behaviours.

You can hit the refresh button to re-randomize the particle system, or the "..." button where you can check the baheviours particles are currently subject to and the "i" button wich is just an about section.

This project was initially built on top of a small library I was coding myself, but it grew independently, it uses Typescript, Tailwind, React-Three-Fiber (and some of its partner libraries) on Next, and on my side I'm also using eslint and prettier.

It is also highly customizable, so feel free to clone and add to this code.

*sugestions for other or my future self*

- create new behaviours!
- create new forms to display the particles
- add tracing paths
- randomize colors within beautiful palettes
- add some nice visual effects
- (huge one) maybe implement this mostly in webgl
