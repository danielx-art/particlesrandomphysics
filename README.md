***Welcome!***

**This is a work in progress project and still does not work**

This is a project I'm developing to randomize physics and particles and displaying them beautifully.
It uses Typescript, Tailwind, React-Three-Fiber (and some of its partner libraries) on Next, and on my side I'm also using eslint and prettier.

***TO DOS***

- create new behaviours!
- deal with display
- deal with tracers (another type of particle that follows fields and need to create a trace rather than a 3d solid)
